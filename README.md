# Helpful Snippets

I am compiling a file of functions, regular expressions, and other snippets I commonly use when developing. This may become an NPM package someday provided it becomes large enough.

I have also chosen to include some resources to help with syntax for a variety of other languages.

If any tools are not mine or of my own creation, I will give proper attribution. Should you find anything out of place, please open a PR or otherwise notify me.
